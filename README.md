# Bugoons â€“ AI Code Reviewer & Refactor Assistant

**Purpose**

Bugoons is an AI-powered tool that reviews your JavaScript code, identifies bugs, suggests improvements, and even refactors your code with a single click.
Whether you paste your code, upload a file, or pull directly from GitHub, Refactora analyzes it for security, performance, and style, then provides a clean, refactored version along with a visual diff.

**Key principles followed**

- **Modularity:** Code is logically separated into self-contained modules for easier maintenance and development.
- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to grow with the project, handling increasing complexity with minimal refactoring.
- **Best Practices:** Adherence to established Node.js and Express conventions for a familiar development experience.
- **Documentation:** Emphasis on thorough explanations within each folder to promote understanding.

**Project Structure Overview**

- **root directory**
  - **src/** - The core source code of the application. [src.md](/src/src.md) - Detailed instructions and documentation for using the source code.
  - **.eslintignore:** Indicates files and directories that should be excluded from ESLint's code quality checks.
  - **.eslint.config.ts:** The core configuration file for ESLint. It defines the JavaScript linting rules and stylistic preferences enforced in the project.
  - **.gitignore:** Lists files and patterns to prevent accidental committing of development artifacts, sensitive data, or large generated files to version control.
  - **.prettierrc:** Configures the Prettier code formatter with preferred formatting rules (semicolons, spacing, quotes, etc.). This promotes code style homogeneity within the project.
  - **LICENSE:** The license governing the use and distribution of the project.
  - **README.md:** Overview of the project, its structure, and key files.
  - **package.json:** Metadata and dependencies for the Node.js project.
  - **package-lock.json:** Lock file automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree or `package.json`.
